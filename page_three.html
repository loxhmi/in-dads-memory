  <p>William III was born on September 22nd, 1963 in Richmond, VA to his mother, Ramona Edmonds Smith, and his father, William Aubrey Smith, Jr. He has one sister - Terry Lee Smith - with whom he grew up until going on to pursue his career as a chef in California. There, William III met and married Monica Chae Smith in 1988 and together they raised 2 children - Jessica Nicole Smith (age 27) and William Aubrey Smith IV (age 24). Their interracial family (Black and Korean) represented a beautiful union of different and clashing cultures in a time of much dividing racial tension. The Chae and Smith families shared many holidays and created many fond memories together. William was a grandfather to 3-year old Three Amari Smith - Jessica’s child. It is with great heaviness we announce that on December 26th, 2020 William Aubrey Smith III passed away at age 57 in his home in Pleasant Hill from a presumed medication overdose (pending toxicology results). His family and friends keep his legacy alive through memories of his unmatched work ethic, alluring personality, and great meals and stories he has shared.
<br><br>
On top of the blessing of a healthy, beautiful family, William also had many successes in his career. William, AKA Chef Will, was a great chef who won numerous awards in cooking competitions and held many achievements as an executive chef of nationally-renowned restaurants and convention centers. When not at work, William enjoyed gardening, riding motorcycles, watching basketball games, and cooking beautiful meals for his family. It is known to most of his loved ones that William struggled with alcoholism and depression as a result of generational-family trauma and the obstacles of growing up and living as a Black man in this society. Dealing with the pressures of his human experience in this world took a toll on William’s mind, body, and spirit. We give honor to the fight of his hardworking body, the fight of his persistent mind, and the continued fight of his forever-living spirit. The lessons and inspirations he has passed on to co-workers, friends, and family are invaluable and will never be forgotten.
<br><br>
William III is survived and carried on by both of his parents, his sister, his wife, his 2 children, and granddaughter as well as their loving dog Ganesh and two cats, Busan and Divine. We pray for his path to be lit, that his spirit be protected, and he be held joyfully in the presence of God, his ancestors, and his loved ones as he enters back into the essence.
