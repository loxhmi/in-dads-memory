"I met your dad in 1980 at Scott's in Jack London Square. He taught me to be a line cook. But he was a best friend from the beginning. We just hit it off." - <b>Peggy</b>
<br><br><br><br>
"I am so very sad and heavy hearted. Such a powerful person! ... We became close quickly. William had a heart that was as big as all outdoors. Everyone that he met here was touched by his demeanor, his compassion, his gentle spirit. Going through the photos I miss him and am still in shock and disbelief. I hope his children know how great a person he was and we are all carrying the pain of this big loss." - <b>Darvin</b>
