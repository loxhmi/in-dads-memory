"I met your dad in 1980 at Scott's in Jack London Square. He taught me to be a line cook. But he was a best friend from the beginning. We just hit it off." - <b>Peggy</b>
<br><br><br><br>
"I am so very sad and heavy hearted. Such a powerful person! ... We became close quickly. William had a heart that was as big as all outdoors. Everyone that he met here was touched by his demeanor, his compassion, his gentle spirit. Going through the photos I miss him and am still in shock and disbelief. I hope his children know how great a person he was and we are all carrying the pain of this big loss." - <b>Darvin</b>

    "Met y'all when I worked with Monica in Houston. The Smiths instantly became our close family friends. The first weekend William was with us at the lake he created a gourmet meal in a camper and on a cook stove! Best camping meal we ever had, and he always cooked amazing meals, no matter what the occasion. He was a great guy and will be greatly missed. So many great memories with the Smiths." - <b>Diane</b>

 "Chef Will taught my mother everything she knows about the kitchen! Her English was not great, but they somehow made it work. I remember going to the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston during December and helping out with the ginger bread houses. It is one of the happiest moments of my childhood! He had such a big heart and a contagious smile.<br><br>
