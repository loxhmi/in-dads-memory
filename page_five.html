  <p>Our dad had a passion for comforting people with food. Many of our fond memories were created with family and friends gathered around the food prepared by our dad. He cooked many meals for his loved ones, church events, meals ministry, and local shelters. He has always said that, "<i>we live in the richest country in the world; there is no reason people should be hungry</i>."
    <br><br>
    Our family would like to continue his legacy by staying involved in meals ministry at his church and facilitating a community garden in his memory, centered on ending food insecurity within local communities.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to donate towards this memorial cause or any one of our dad's favorite charities listed below, please do so in his name.
